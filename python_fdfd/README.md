## About
This is a 2D finite difference frequency domain (FDFD) code for optical and electromagnetic systems. This package can currently perform both driven (e.g. electric and magnetic current sources) and modal calculations (e.g. guided wave vector and resonant frequencies). The image above shows an example modal calculation. 

## Credit
Credit for the FDFD algorithm goes to Jerry Shi and Wonseok Shin, both of the Fan group at Stanford. There are two MATLAB implementations of FDFD available, both of which are likely to be more functional than this package.
